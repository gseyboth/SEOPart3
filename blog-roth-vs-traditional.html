  <h1>Roth vs Traditional IRA: Which One Should You Choose?</h1>

  <p>Planning for retirement? One of the biggest decisions is whether to invest in a <strong>Roth IRA</strong> or a <strong>Traditional IRA</strong>. Both accounts help you grow your money tax-advantaged, but they work in opposite ways when it comes to taxes.</p>

  <h2>Key Differences Between Roth and Traditional IRAs</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Roth IRA:</strong> Pay taxes on your contributions now, and enjoy tax-free withdrawals in retirement.</li>
    <li><strong>Traditional IRA:</strong> Contributions may be tax-deductible now, but withdrawals are taxed in retirement.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Contribution Limits for 2025</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Under age 50:</strong> Up to $7,000 total contributions across all IRAs.</li>
    <li><strong>Age 50 or older:</strong> Up to $8,000 total (includes a $1,000 catch-up contribution).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These limits apply whether you choose Roth, Traditional, or a mix of both.</p>

  <h2>Income Limits for Roth IRA Contributions</h2>
  <p>High earners may be limited in how much they can contribute to a Roth IRA. For 2025:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Single filers:</strong> Contributions begin to phase out at $146,000 and end at $161,000 of modified adjusted gross income (MAGI).</li>
    <li><strong>Married filing jointly:</strong> Phase-out starts at $230,000 and ends at $240,000 of MAGI.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Withdrawal Rules</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Roth IRA:</strong> No required minimum distributions (RMDs). Withdraw your contributions anytime tax- and penalty-free. Earnings can be withdrawn tax-free after age 59½ if the account has been open at least 5 years.</li>
    <li><strong>Traditional IRA:</strong> Required minimum distributions begin at age 73. Early withdrawals before age 59½ are taxed and penalized (with some exceptions).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Example Scenario</h2>
  <p>Mike is 30 years old and earns $60,000 per year. He expects his income and tax bracket to be higher in retirement. Mike chooses a <strong>Roth IRA</strong> to pay taxes now while his rates are lower and enjoy tax-free withdrawals later.</p>

  <p>Sarah is 55 years old and earns $120,000. She wants to lower her taxable income today and expects her retirement income to be lower. Sarah chooses a <strong>Traditional IRA</strong> for the current tax break.</p>
