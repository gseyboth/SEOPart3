  <h2>Who Needs to Pay Quarterly Taxes?</h2>
  <p>If you're self-employed, freelance, or run a small business and expect to owe $1,000 or more in taxes, you're likely required to pay estimated quarterly taxes. This includes federal income tax, self-employment tax (Social Security and Medicare), and possibly state tax depending on where you live.</p>

  <h2>Tips to Stay on Track</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Set calendar reminders for each payment deadline.</li>
    <li>Use accounting software or apps that automate tracking.</li>
    <li>Consider saving ~25–30% of income for tax payments.</li>
    <li>Use the <a href="/contractor-tax-estimator">Contractor Tax Estimator</a> to calculate how much to pay each quarter.</li>
  </ul>
