  <h1>Self-Employed Tax Deadlines You Can’t Miss</h1>

  <p>If you’re a freelancer, contractor, or small business owner, you’re responsible for paying your own taxes — and that means remembering your <strong>quarterly estimated tax deadlines</strong>. Missing these deadlines can result in penalties and interest.</p>

  <h2>2025 Estimated Tax Deadlines</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>April 15, 2025:</strong> Q1 payment (January 1 – March 31 income)</li>
    <li><strong>June 16, 2025:</strong> Q2 payment (April 1 – May 31 income)</li>
    <li><strong>September 15, 2025:</strong> Q3 payment (June 1 – August 31 income)</li>
    <li><strong>January 15, 2026:</strong> Q4 payment (September 1 – December 31 income)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Note: When the deadline falls on a weekend or holiday, it moves to the next business day.</p>

  <h2>Who Needs to Pay Quarterly Taxes?</h2>
  <p>You must make estimated tax payments if:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You expect to owe at least $1,000 in taxes after subtracting withholding and credits</li>
    <li>Your income isn’t subject to tax withholding (like 1099 income or side hustle profits)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to Estimate Your Payments</h2>
  <p>Estimate your total yearly income and self-employment tax, then divide it by four payments. You can adjust quarterly as your income changes.</p>

  <h2>Example Scenario</h2>
  <p>Sam expects to earn $80,000 freelancing in 2025. He estimates $20,000 in taxes for the year. He pays $5,000 quarterly to stay caught up.</p>
