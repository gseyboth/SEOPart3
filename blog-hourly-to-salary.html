  <h1>How to Convert Hourly Pay to Salary (With Examples)</h1>

  <p>Wondering what your hourly pay translates to in yearly salary? It’s a common question for freelancers, gig workers, and anyone considering a new job offer.</p>

  <h2>The Basic Formula</h2>
  <p>Take your hourly wage, multiply by 40 hours/week, then by 52 weeks/year. For example:</p>
  <pre>$20/hour × 40 × 52 = $41,600/year</pre>

  <h2>What to Consider</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Are you paid for holidays and time off?</li>
    <li>Do you work overtime?</li>
    <li>Are you self-employed (and paying self-employment tax)?</li>
  </ul>
