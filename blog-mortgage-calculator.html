  <h1>How to Estimate Your Monthly Mortgage Payment</h1>

  <p>Buying a home? One of the first questions you’ll face is: <strong>How much will my monthly mortgage payment be?</strong> Your mortgage payment isn’t just your loan principal and interest — it also includes property taxes, homeowner’s insurance, and sometimes mortgage insurance (PMI).</p>

  <h2>The 4 Parts of a Mortgage Payment (PITI)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Principal:</strong> The portion of your payment that reduces your loan balance.</li>
    <li><strong>Interest:</strong> The cost of borrowing from the lender.</li>
    <li><strong>Taxes:</strong> Property taxes paid to your local government.</li>
    <li><strong>Insurance:</strong> Homeowner's insurance and, if required, private mortgage insurance (PMI).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Mortgage Payment Example</h2>
  <p>Let’s say you buy a $300,000 home with a 20% down payment and a 6.5% interest rate on a 30-year loan:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Loan amount: $240,000</li>
    <li>Estimated monthly principal + interest: $1,518</li>
    <li>Estimated taxes + insurance: $300</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Total estimated monthly payment: $1,818</strong></p>

  <h2>What Can Change Your Payment?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Loan term (15 years vs 30 years)</li>
    <li>Interest rate</li>
    <li>Down payment amount</li>
    <li>Local property taxes</li>
    <li>Whether you need PMI</li>
  </ul>
