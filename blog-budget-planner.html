  <h1>How to Create a Budget That Actually Works</h1>

  <p>Creating a budget doesn’t have to be complicated. A good budget simply helps you plan how you’ll spend and save your money — without feeling restricted. Whether you prefer apps, spreadsheets, or pencil and paper, the basic steps are the same.</p>

  <h2>Step 1: Calculate Your Monthly Income</h2>
  <p>Start with your take-home pay from your job, side hustle, or freelance gigs. Include any regular income sources like rental income or support payments.</p>

  <h2>Step 2: List Your Monthly Expenses</h2>
  <p>Break your expenses into categories like:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Housing (rent/mortgage, utilities)</li>
    <li>Transportation (car payment, gas, insurance)</li>
    <li>Groceries and dining out</li>
    <li>Debt payments (credit cards, student loans)</li>
    <li>Savings and investments</li>
    <li>Entertainment and lifestyle</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 3: Balance Your Budget</h2>
  <p>Subtract your expenses from your income. If your expenses are higher, look for areas to cut back. If you have extra left over, allocate it toward savings, debt payoff, or your financial goals.</p>

  <h2>Step 4: Adjust Monthly as Needed</h2>
  <p>Your income and expenses may change month to month. Check your budget regularly and adjust categories as life happens. Flexibility is key.</p>

  <h2>Budget Example</h2>
  <p>Let’s say Emily earns $3,500 per month after taxes. Her fixed expenses total $2,200, and her variable expenses (groceries, gas, entertainment) are around $800. She allocates the remaining $500 toward savings and debt payments.</p>
