  <h1>Debt Snowball vs Avalanche: Which Debt Payoff Method Is Best?</h1>

  <p>Paying off debt doesn’t have to feel overwhelming. Two of the most popular strategies are the <strong>Debt Snowball</strong> and <strong>Debt Avalanche</strong> methods. Both work — but which one fits your financial goals better?</p>

  <h2>Debt Snowball Method</h2>
  <p>The snowball method focuses on paying off your <strong>smallest balance first</strong>, regardless of the interest rate. This approach builds motivation by giving you quick wins early in your debt payoff journey.</p>

  <h3>✅ Pros of the Snowball Method:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Gives you faster emotional victories</li>
    <li>Simplifies your debt plan</li>
    <li>Helps you stay motivated longer</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>⚠️ Cons of the Snowball Method:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>You might pay more interest overall</li>
    <li>Not mathematically the fastest option</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Debt Avalanche Method</h2>
  <p>The avalanche method pays off your <strong>highest-interest debt first</strong>, saving you the most money over time. You'll tackle the most expensive debt even if it has a larger balance.</p>

  <h3>✅ Pros of the Avalanche Method:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Saves more money on interest</li>
    <li>Mathematically the fastest way to pay off debt</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>⚠️ Cons of the Avalanche Method:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>It may take longer to pay off your first debt</li>
    <li>Some people lose motivation without quick wins</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Example: Snowball vs Avalanche</h2>
  <p>Let’s say Sarah has these debts:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Credit Card A: $500 at 18% APR</li>
    <li>Credit Card B: $1,500 at 22% APR</li>
    <li>Student Loan: $4,000 at 6% APR</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Using Snowball:</strong> She pays off Credit Card A first ($500), then B, then the student loan. She feels motivated by clearing a debt quickly.</p>

  <p><strong>Using Avalanche:</strong> She pays off Credit Card B first (22% APR), then A, then the student loan. She saves more in interest over time, but it takes longer to clear her first debt.</p>

  <h2>Which Should You Choose?</h2>
  <p>If you’re motivated by <strong>quick wins and progress</strong>, the snowball method may be better. If you want to save <strong>the most money on interest</strong>, the avalanche method wins mathematically.</p>

  <p>Ultimately, the best debt payoff method is the one you’ll stick with. Consistency matters more than perfection.</p>
