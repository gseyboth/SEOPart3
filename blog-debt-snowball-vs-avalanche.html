  <h1>Debt Snowball vs Avalanche: Which Should You Use?</h1>

  <p>Trying to pay off debt? Two of the most popular strategies are the Debt Snowball and the Debt Avalanche methods. But which one is right for you?</p>

  <h2>Snowball Method</h2>
  <p>With the snowball method, you pay off the smallest balance first to gain momentum. It’s great for motivation and quick wins.</p>

  <h2>Avalanche Method</h2>
  <p>The avalanche method pays off the highest-interest debt first. It saves more money in the long run but takes discipline.</p>

  <h2>Which Is Better?</h2>
  <p>If you're driven by psychology, choose Snowball. If you’re focused on math and savings, go Avalanche.</p>
