  <h1>Roth vs Traditional IRA: Which One Saves You More?</h1>

  <p>Choosing between a Roth IRA and a Traditional IRA can be tricky, especially if you're trying to minimize taxes now versus later. Both are powerful retirement tools, but the right choice depends on your current income, future tax expectations, and savings goals.</p>

  <h2>Key Differences</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Roth IRA:</strong> Contributions are made with after-tax dollars. Withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.</li>
    <li><strong>Traditional IRA:</strong> Contributions may be tax-deductible now, but withdrawals are taxed later.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>When to Choose Roth</h2>
  <p>If you're in a lower tax bracket now and expect to earn more later, a Roth IRA helps lock in today's tax rate. Itâ€™s also great for younger savers.</p>

  <h2>When to Choose Traditional</h2>
  <p>If you want to reduce your taxable income now and think your retirement tax rate will be lower, the Traditional IRA might be better.</p>
