  <h1>How to Set and Hit Your Savings Goal Faster</h1>

  <p>Whether you're saving for a house, emergency fund, or vacation, a clear savings goal makes all the difference. Here’s how to crush it faster.</p>

  <h2>1. Know Your Target</h2>
  <p>Decide on a clear number: $1,000, $5,000, or more. Be specific about what you're saving for and when you want to reach it.</p>

  <h2>2. Break It Down</h2>
  <p>Divide your goal into monthly or weekly amounts. That turns a big goal into small, achievable wins.</p>

  <h2>3. Track Your Progress</h2>
  <p>Use our <a href="/savings-goal-calculator">Savings Goal Calculator</a> to figure out exactly how much to set aside each month — and see when you’ll hit your target.</p>
