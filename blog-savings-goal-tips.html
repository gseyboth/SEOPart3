  <h1>How to Set a Savings Goal (and Actually Reach It)</h1>

  <p>Whether you're saving for an emergency fund, a vacation, or a new car, having a clear savings goal can help you stay motivated and on track. But it’s not enough to just say, “I want to save more.” A strong savings goal includes a target amount and a realistic timeline.</p>

  <h2>Step 1: Set a Specific Goal Amount</h2>
  <p>Decide what you're saving for and how much you’ll need. Example goals:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>$1,000 for an emergency fund</li>
    <li>$5,000 for a vacation</li>
    <li>$15,000 for a car down payment</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 2: Choose a Deadline</h2>
  <p>Pick a target date for your savings goal. The shorter your timeline, the more you'll need to save each month.</p>

  <h2>Step 3: Calculate Your Monthly Savings</h2>
  <p>Divide your goal amount by the number of months until your deadline. For example, saving $5,000 in 10 months means saving $500 per month.</p>

  <h2>Example Scenario</h2>
  <p>Jessica wants to save $3,600 for a vacation 12 months from now. She’ll need to save:</p>
  <p>$3,600 ÷ 12 = $300 per month</p>

  <h2>Step 4: Automate Your Savings</h2>
  <p>Consider setting up an automatic transfer to your savings account right after you get paid. This helps make saving a habit.</p>
