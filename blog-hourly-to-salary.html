  <h1>How to Convert Hourly Pay to Salary (Step-by-Step Guide)</h1>

  <p>If you’re paid by the hour, it’s helpful to understand how your wage translates to an annual salary. Whether you’re budgeting for the year, comparing a job offer, or negotiating a raise, converting hourly to salary gives you a bigger picture of your income.</p>

  <h2>Hourly to Salary Formula</h2>
  <p>The basic formula to convert your hourly wage to an annual salary is:</p>

  <p><strong>Hourly Wage × Hours per Week × 52 Weeks per Year</strong></p>

  <p>Example: $20/hour × 40 hours/week × 52 weeks = $41,600 per year</p>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> This assumes you work every week of the year. If you take unpaid time off or have seasonal work, your annual income will be lower.</p>

  <h2>Include Overtime, Bonuses, and PTO</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Overtime:</strong> Add estimated overtime earnings to your annual pay.</li>
    <li><strong>Bonuses:</strong> Include recurring bonuses or incentives if applicable.</li>
    <li><strong>Paid Time Off (PTO):</strong> If your employer offers PTO, your annual pay stays the same even when you take time off.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common Hourly to Salary Conversions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>$15/hour ≈ $31,200 per year</li>
    <li>$20/hour ≈ $41,600 per year</li>
    <li>$25/hour ≈ $52,000 per year</li>
    <li>$30/hour ≈ $62,400 per year</li>
    <li>$50/hour ≈ $104,000 per year</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why Your Salary May Vary</h2>
  <p>Your exact yearly earnings depend on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Actual hours worked per week</li>
    <li>Unpaid time off or holidays</li>
    <li>Overtime pay</li>
    <li>Bonuses and commissions</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Hourly to Salary Example Scenario</h2>
  <p>Alex works as a graphic designer making $28 per hour, working 38 hours per week. His estimated salary is:</p>

  <p>$28 × 38 hours/week × 52 weeks = $55,328 per year</p>

  <p>However, Alex usually takes 2 weeks of unpaid vacation, so his actual yearly pay is slightly lower.</p>
