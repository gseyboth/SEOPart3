  <h1>Self-Employed Contractor Taxes Explained (What You Need to Know)</h1>

  <p>If you're a freelancer, independent contractor, or gig worker, your taxes work differently from W-2 employees. Instead of having taxes withheld from your paycheck, you'll pay estimated taxes on your income. Here's how it works—and how to plan for it.</p>

  <h2>What Counts as Contractor Income?</h2>
  <p>You’re considered self-employed if you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Receive 1099 forms from clients or platforms (Uber, Upwork, etc.)</li>
    <li>Run a side hustle, freelance business, or small shop</li>
    <li>Sell services or goods as a sole proprietor</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The Two Main Self-Employment Taxes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Income Tax:</strong> Based on your total profit after expenses. Rates follow the same tax brackets as regular employees.</li>
    <li><strong>Self-Employment Tax:</strong> Covers Social Security and Medicare. It’s roughly <strong>15.3%</strong> on your net earnings.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to Estimate Contractor Taxes</h2>
  <p>As a rough rule of thumb:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Set aside 25%–30% of your income for taxes.</li>
    <li>This covers federal income tax, self-employment tax, and possibly state taxes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Example Scenario</h2>
  <p>Maria earns $60,000 from freelance graphic design. She deducts $10,000 in business expenses, leaving $50,000 net income.</p>
  <p>Estimated taxes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Federal income tax: ~$5,000 (varies by bracket)</li>
    <li>Self-employment tax: ~$7,650 (15.3% of $50,000)</li>
  </ul>
